 # (Drupal + React) Learning Project
## Overview
This project is a Drupal 10 site that integrates React.js to build dynamic frontend components. It serves as a learning platform to explore the interaction between Drupal as a CMS and React for building modern, interactive UIs.

or RESTful API from Drupal to fetch and display content in React components.
- Includes Axios for making HTTP requests from React to the Drupal API.
- Simple search and display of content (like Cat Images from an API) using React.

- How to integrate React into a Drupal site.
- How to fetch content from Drupal's API endpoints and use it in React components.
- Explore modern frontend and backend interactions in a headless or decoupled architecture.
-
